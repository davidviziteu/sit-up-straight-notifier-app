# sit-up-straight-notifier-app
Minimalist app that notifies you to sit up straight, probably reducing your backache at the end of a long, full of online conferences day of self-isolation.

How to install: download app.zip from APP.EXE folder. Chose a destination where you want the app's files to be. Unzip the archive there. Run the .exe file. That's it at the moment. I'll create an installer when I'll fully understand how to / how they work.

The app shoud automatically launch as soon as the user logs in after every restart.

How to uninstall: delete the 'destination' folder mentioned at 'how to install'.
